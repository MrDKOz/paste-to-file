# Paste to File
Paste to File is a small utility, that adds a context menu labeled "Paste to File" when you right-click in a directory. Clicking this entry will automatically create a new file relevent to the data you had within your clipboard.

Current clipboard data supported:
 - Text
 - Image

Opening the program without using the context menu, also allows you to edit such features as:
  - Setting a filename mask
	  - e.g. **%y%mo%d%h%mi%s-Text** will name the file **20200113-Text** upon pasting
  - Setting a default file extension. By default it will output .txt files, however, this can be changed
  - Output prompt - If you don't fancy using the defaults everytime, you can opt to be prompted each time you paste, allowing you to choose these options with every paste
  - The configuration screen, also allows you to easilty Add/Remove the context entry registry keys - there is no install.
